Vim tips 

TODO:
- [x] Upload .vimrc to github
- [x] Create a key mapping for resizing windows

Use :find *ilename to open/edit file of name filename nested in subdirectories
Use :b filen<TAB> to switch to open buffer of file filename

gcc to (un)comment line

cs”’ to Change Surroundings from double quotes to single
Cs’<p> to change surroundings from single quote to p tag
cst” to change surroundings from tag to double quotes
ds” to delete surrounding double quotes

cit to change inner tag (ex: between <p> tags)
ciw, ci” work too

Ctrl-n to autocomplete

Map ctrl up/down to move a line of code up or down. Ctrl-option up/down duplicates a line...
NVM now up and down are mapped to resize window. 
Try coming up with another mapping for this useful purpose

t goes forward till given character
f goes forward 1 past given character

# or * immediately searches for word under cursor?

ctrl-[ instead of esc!

; repeats forward navigation

, <enter> maps to :noh
, w maps to :w

:tabe <file> opens a file in a new tab
gt goes to the next tab 
gT goes to the previous tab
{i}gt goes to tab if the left child's maximum height augmentation is not greater than $j$,
either descend down to the right child and continue this procedure, or if the right child 
does not exist or the right child's max height augmentation is not greater than $j$,
return the current node as the successor.
